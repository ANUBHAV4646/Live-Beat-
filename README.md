# Project: Live Beat Website
This project showcases a website I developed for Live Beat, a company that organizes live music concerts featuring renowned artists from all over the world. Using basic HTML and CSS, I created a user-friendly platform to promote upcoming events and artists. Live Beat offers a dynamic concert experience, and their upcoming artist lineup includes international stars like Diljit Dosanjh, Karan Aujla, Anuv Jain, and Coldplay. The site is designed to engage music lovers and provide all necessary information about these exciting live performances.







I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who supported and guided me throughout the development of the Live Beat website. First and foremost, I extend my sincerest thanks to Dr. Ramandeep Kaur, whose invaluable guidance and constructive feedback were instrumental in shaping the direction and structure of this project. Their expertise and patience helped me navigate the challenges of web development, and their encouragement was a constant source of motivation throughout the process.

I am also deeply grateful to my family and friends, who provided unwavering moral support and motivation during the development of this website. Their belief in my abilities pushed me to continue improving and refining the platform, even during the more challenging phases of the project.

Additionally, I would like to acknowledge the resources that provided technical support and tutorials, such as W3Schools, which proved invaluable in resolving coding issues and enhancing my understanding of HTML and CSS. The knowledge shared by these communities played a crucial role in the successful completion of the Live Beat website.
